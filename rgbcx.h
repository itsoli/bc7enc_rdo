//
// This is a single header file library. Be sure to "#define RGBCX_IMPLEMENTATION" in one .cpp file somewhere.
//
// Instructions:
//
// The library MUST be initialized by calling this function at least once before using any encoder or decoder functions:
//
// void rgbcx::init(bc1_approx_mode mode = cBC1Ideal);
//
// This function manipulates global state, so it is not thread safe.
// You can call it multiple times to change the global BC1 approximation mode.
// Important: BC1/3 textures encoded using non-ideal BC1 approximation modes should only be sampled on parts from that vendor.
// If you encode for AMD, average error on AMD parts will go down, but average error on NVidia parts will go up and vice versa.
// If in doubt, encode in ideal BC1 mode.
//
// Call these functions to encode BC1-5:
// void rgbcx::encode_bc1(uint32_t level, void* pDst, const uint8_t* pPixels, bool allow_3color, bool use_transparent_texels_for_black);
// void rgbcx::encode_bc3(uint32_t level, void* pDst, const uint8_t* pPixels);
// void rgbcx::encode_bc4(void* pDst, const uint8_t* pPixels, uint32_t stride = 4);
// void rgbcx::encode_bc5(void* pDst, const uint8_t* pPixels, uint32_t chan0 = 0, uint32_t chan1 = 1, uint32_t stride = 4);
//
// - level ranges from MIN_LEVEL to MAX_LEVEL. The higher the level, the slower the encoder goes, but the higher the average quality.
// levels [0,4] are fast and compete against stb_dxt (default and HIGHQUAL). The remaining levels compete against squish/NVTT/icbc and icbc HQ.
// If in doubt just use level 10, set allow_3color to true and use_transparent_texels_for_black to false, and adjust as needed.
//
// - pDst is a pointer to the 8-byte (BC1/4) or 16-byte (BC3/5) destination block.
//
// - pPixels is a pointer to the 32-bpp pixels, in either RGBX or RGBA format (R is first in memory).
// Alpha is always ignored by encode_bc1().
//
// - allow_3color: If true the encoder will use 3-color blocks. This flag is ignored unless level is >= 5 (because lower levels compete against stb_dxt and it doesn't support 3-color blocks).
// Do not enable on BC3-5 textures. 3-color block usage slows down encoding.
//
// - use_transparent_texels_for_black: If true the encoder will use 3-color block transparent black pixels to code very dark or black texels. Your engine/shader MUST ignore the sampled
// alpha value for textures encoded in this mode. This is how NVidia's classic "nvdxt" encoder (used by many original Xbox titles) used to work by default on DXT1C textures. It increases
// average quality substantially (because dark texels/black are very common) and is highly recommended.
// Do not enable on BC3-5 textures.
//
// - stride is the source pixel stride, in bytes. It's typically 4.
//
// - chan0 and chan1 are the source channels. Typically they will be 0 and 1.
//
// All encoding and decoding functions are threade-safe.
//
// To reduce the compiled size of the encoder, set #define RGBCX_USE_SMALLER_TABLES to 1 before including this header.
